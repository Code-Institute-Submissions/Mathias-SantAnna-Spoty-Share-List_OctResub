# Spoty Share List
It's a web application for sharing Playlists with it's users. The objective is to intensify and amplify the usage of music streaming services like SpotifyÂ®

Since everyone loves music (and I even more), why not do something enjoyable  and productive in the same time. As we all know, these days the consumption of the streaming services are only growing, and a great tool to have is to be part of a awesome group of people with great music taste, some may discord, where you can create, edit, share your Playlists and much more...(more features to be added in the future).
