## User Experience Planes

### Strategy Plane
The website is designed for the people who would like to share and find different spotify playlists, add to their own catalog, share with friends, while working, excercing or just for the fun or it, it's a great tool of motivation, scientofically proofed to increased someone's performance up to 30%.Following simple steps users can Register to create an account, to create a new Playlist in a very easy way. Users which are just visiting can see all the playlists shown by post date, or browse by music genre(Music Genre), or even by artists. Also they can click in the playlist url field that would send them to the existing playlist in Spotify. A search field is on these pages to help the user to find what they're looking for, using a specific keyword(s). To open a specific playlist the visitor don't need to register himself, only for adding new ones, editing or deleting your playlists. The website design is simple and user friendly for the first-time visitor easily start navigating. Also for creating a new playlist is a set of instructions for the "hardest parts" like to add a Url for the specific spotify.

The page style is the same as *Register | Login*, and users can go back to *Profile* page by clicking Gingerbread man icon or cancel button

- **Edit Playlist** &#40;`edit_playlist.html`&#41;<br>The page where users can edit playlists.

Below is the chart of the website to show the core relationships between the pages. &#40;Most of the pages are linked to each other subject to permission&#41;<br>

‚Äî **Back-end** ‚Äî<br>
Users must have an account to create playlists so there is a **users collection** that has <ins>username</ins> and <ins>password</ins> as keys of the data. <ins>username</ins> in **users collections** is linked with the <ins>username</ins> in **playlists collection** because users who have an account can only create a Playlist and they create a Playlist in their own account. Same principle as <ins>username</ins> in **users collection** that users can only create a Playlist for the Music Genre available in a **Music Genre collection** so it is liked with <ins>playlist_name</ins> in **playlists collection**. Music Genre in **Music Genre collection** are editable by admin so it is created as an independent collection. Data in **subscription collection** is independent data for newsletters because users who do not have an account can also subscribe to it if they wish to do. The data in all the collections are retrievable and can be identified by the key or unique id of the object.

Below is the chart of the database to show the collections and their relationships.

> **Note:**<br>
> On the subscription collection, subs_name is listed but the subscribe function collects e-mail address only
