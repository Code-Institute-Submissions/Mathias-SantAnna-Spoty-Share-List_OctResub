- Simple design Home page that first-time users can recognise the purpose of the website easily. All the playlists are shown on *Home* page &#40;R&#41;
- Music Genre &#40;Metal, Dance & Electro, Rock&#41; pages where users can see playlists by the Music Genre &#40;R&#41;
- Register page where users can create an account to create, post and edit playlists
- Login page where users can log in to the website

- Create Playlist page where users can create and post their playlists &#40;C&#41;
- Edit Playlist page where users can edit their playlists &#40;U&#41;
- Delete Playlist function that users can delete their playlists &#40;D&#41;

> Initially, only 3 fixed Music Genre are planned for playlists, however as the project is created, discover that a newly created playlist can be implemented on the website by using loop so Music Genre are not limited. &#40;e.g. If the admin decides to create a new playlist called "Birthday", it can be implemented to the website automatically&#41;

### Structure Plane

‚Äî **Front-end** ‚Äî

The website consists of a **Home** page with **13 other core pages**.

- **Home** &#40;`index.html`&#41;<br>The main page of the website. There is a logo, navigation bar to *Music Genre*, *Register* & *Login* pages, a title and a hero image. All the summary of playlists are contained and users can access a full *Playlist* page. There is a footer with a form to subscribe to newsletter and some social icons

- **Search Result** &#40;`search.html`&#41;<br>The page where users can see playlists by search and access a full *Playlist* page. The same navigation bar and footer are used as *Home* *Idea of having this page comes up during the project

- **Music Genre** &#40;`Music Genre_<genre_name>.html`&#41;<br>The pages where users can see playlists by playlist and access a full *Playlist* page. The same navigation bar and footer are used as *Home*

- **Playlist** &#40;`Playlist.html`&#41;<br>The page where a full Playlist is shown individually. The same navigation bar and footer are used as *Home*

- **Register** &#40;`register.html`&#41;<br>The page where users can create an account. Once users create an account successfully, they will be led to *Profile* page. The navigation bar is different to *Home* page, in which users can go back to *Home* page by clicking Uncle Jam's icon, and there is no footer

- **Login** &#40;`login.html`&#41;<br>The page where users who have an account can log in to the website. Once users log in successfully, they will be led to *Profile* page. The navigation bar is different to *Home* page, in which users can go back to *Home* page by clicking Uncle Jam's icon, and there is no footer

- **Profile** &#40;`profile.html`&#41;<br>The page where users will be led when they create an account or log in. Users see all of their playlists with an option to edit&#47;delete. Users can access to *Edit Playlist* page and *Delete Playlist* function by clicking a button on the Playlist. There is an option to create a new Playlist from this page by clicking a button and that leads to *Create Playlist* page. The same navigation bar and footer are used as *Home* but there is a *Logout* function instead of *Register* and *Login*. There is also a link to *Profile* page on the navigation bar

- **Create Playlist** &#40;`add_playlist.html`&#41;<br>The page where users can create and post playlists. There is no link on the navigation bar and it can only be accessed by clicking a Create Playlist button on *Profile* page. The page style is the same as *Register | Login*, and users can go back to *Profile* page by clicking Gingerbread man icon or cancel button

- **Edit Playlist** &#40;`edit_playlist.html`&#41;<br>The page where users can edit playlists. There is no link on the navigation bar and it can only be accessed by clicking an Edit button on *Profile* page. The page style is the same as *Register | Login*, and users can go back to *Profile* page by clicking Gingerbread man icon or cancel button

- **Edit Genre** &#40;`edit_genre.html`&#41;<br>The page where only <ins>admin user</ins> &#40;owner&#41; can access to create and edit Music genre pages as well as to delete Music Genre. Only admin user can have an access to this page by a navigation link that appears on *Profile* page for admin. The page style is the same as *Home*

- **Create Genre** &#40;`add_genre.html`&#41;<br>The page where only <ins>admin user</ins> &#40;owner&#41; can create Music Genre. The page style is the same as *Register | Login*, and admin user can go back to *Manage playlist* page by clicking Tools icon or cancel button

- **Page 404** &#40;`page_404.html`&#41;<br>The page that informs users the page not found and takes them back to *Home* page safely. The page style is the same as *Register | Login*.

Summary of playlists and full playlists are accessible by any users. Summary of playlists are available on *Home* and *Music Genre* pages and full playlists are available on *Playlists* page.

Below is the chart of the website to show the core relationships between the pages. &#40;Most of the pages are linked to each other subject to permission&#41;<br>

![image](https://github.com/Mathias-SantAnna/Spoty-Share-List/blob/master/static/images/SiteMap2.0.png)<br>

‚Äî **Back-end** ‚Äî<br>
Users must have an account to create playlists so there is a **users collection** that has <ins>username</ins> and <ins>password</ins> as keys of the data. <ins>username</ins> in **users collections** is linked with the <ins>username</ins> in **playlists collection** because users who have an account can only create a Playlist and they create a Playlist in their own account. Same principle as <ins>username</ins> in **users collection** that users can only create a Playlist for the Music Genre available in a **Music Genre collection** so it is liked with <ins>playlist_name</ins> in **playlists collection**. Music Genre in **Music Genre collection** are editable by admin so it is created as an independent collection. Data in **subscription collection** is independent data for newsletters because users who do not have an account can also subscribe to it if they wish to do. The data in all the collections are retrievable and can be identified by the key or unique id of the object.

Below is the chart of the database to show the collections and their relationships.

> **Note:**<br>
> On the subscription collection, subs_name is listed but the subscribe function collects e-mail address only

### Skeleton Plane

It is a mobile-first website because people usually bake with a playlist so a good mobile-first design helps users whose main purpose is seeing playlists. For users whose main purpose is creating and posting playlists, the form is also well designed on both mobile and desktop sizes. There are wireframes of mobile and desktop sizes for all the core pages of the website.

### Surface Plane

‚Äî **Colour** ‚Äî

Inspired in the famous music streaming service, the base color is lime green &#40;#21E666&#41;. It is used as it is on some headings, texts as well as the navigation bar, footer, and slightly transparent colour is used for some background. Regular Black and White are used for some text and background when it needs contrast. Also the same lime green is used when it needs an accent on the website such as See playlist button, flash messages and hover effect.

[![Color-Palette.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gc8hRqR3/Color-Palette.png)](https://postimg.cc/MXZXJB9G)

‚Äî **Typography** ‚Äî

For the Logo was used **Monserrat Classic**, **Moontime**, and **Blibker Thin**.
For &#40;h1&#41; and headings of other pages &#40;h2&#41; was also used **Monserrat**.

**Raleway**, which is also another type of This is a powerful typeface, is used for menu and other headings &#40;h3 - h6&#41; as it matches the image of the website well.

## FEATURES

### Existing Features

- Create with **HTML5**, **CSS3** &#40;with Materialize &#41;, **JavaScript**, **Python** &#40;Flask&#41;, **MongoDB** &#40;Atlas&#41;
- It consists of 1 base html file and 13 other html files
- Modal for "Create Playlist" instructions and confirmation for "Delete" function
- Upload Image For Each Playlist: Image data cannot be stored in MongoDB, so having image for Playlists is achieved by using image URL.
- Spotify Embed iframe, for a sample view of the Playlist selected. 
- CONTINUE... ???

### Features Left To Implement

- **Resetting Password When Users Forget It:** To achieve this, an e-mail address is probably required for creating an account. The current primary purpose of the website is to provide easy access to the platform so do not ask e-mail address to create an account. In addition, do not know how to implement this with my current skills, decide to leave this out.

- **Share Button:** Do not know how to achieve this with my current skill and do not have time to learn so decide to leave this out.

- **‚ÄúLike‚Äù Reaction By Other Users:** Do not know how to achieve this with my current skill and do not have time to learn so decide to leave this out.

- **Customise Pagination Page Display:** Manage to do pagination as it is essential to make the website neat, however, do not know how to customise pagination page display &#40;e.g. When there are more Playlists, it will show page 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...&#41; and do not have time to look into details so decide to leave as it is.

- **Error Pages:** Only one type of error page &#40;404&#41; is set up for the project. Ideally, users should be directed to a specific error page depending on the type of the error, however, do not have time to implement this so leave this out.

- **Hook Up a Spotify API** Where the user can connect to it's Spotify account and there bring data like their playlists, all with two clicks. I'm very exciting to be able to implement this feature in the future.
