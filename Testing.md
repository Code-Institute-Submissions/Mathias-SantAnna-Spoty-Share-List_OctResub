Following the completion of the fundamental HTML code across all HTML files in the project, a code
validation test is performed using the W3C Markup Validation Service, which is a validator provided
by the World Wide Web Consortium for checking HTML and XHTML files for well-designed markup,
scanning any warnings and errors. Because the Flask Jinja template is applied in all HTML files, the
source code for testing is retrieved from the displayed pages.
